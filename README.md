# ai-genre-pipeline

Turn a single `.env` file into an AI-generated **song + cohesive music video** with a
**consistent character** across every scene — in the style of ambient/cinematic music
channels (FeelTheDeepLiveTheCalm / Thungdor).

Spinning up a brand-new genre is the #1 design goal: **copy an `.env`, edit the creative
block, run.** No code changes.

```
.env  ─▶  LLM (concept · lyrics · Visual Bible · scenes)
      ─▶  reference images  ─▶  per-scene key-frames  ─▶  video clips
      ─▶  music (Suno brief / API / local)
      ─▶  FFmpeg final cut (timed, audio-synced, optional lyric overlay)
      ─▶  (optional) 24/7 live stream to YouTube / TikTok / Facebook / Rumble
```

## Why this produces *consistent* characters

Consistency is engineered, not hoped for:

1. **Visual Bible** — generated once per run, it locks a single, physically-specific
   `character_description`, color palette, lighting and negative prompts.
2. **That exact description is injected into every image and video prompt** verbatim.
3. **Character reference images** are generated once and (with the ComfyUI backend +
   an IP-Adapter workflow) fed into every scene to lock face/wardrobe.
4. **Image-to-video**: the video stage animates the scene *still* (which already encodes
   the character) instead of generating from scratch — the model only adds motion.
5. **Deterministic seeds** keep results stable across re-runs.

---

## Quick start (Docker — recommended)

```bash
# 1. Pick a genre and create your .env
cp .env.example .env            # deep house / ocean
#   or: cp .env.cyberpunk.example .env
#   or: cp .env.country-trance.example .env

# 2. Put your API keys in .env (only for the backends you enabled)

# 3. Sanity-check config + ffmpeg + keys
docker compose run --rm orchestrator doctor

# 4. Generate everything
docker compose run --rm orchestrator run
```

Every run's output is written to a **persistent Docker data volume** (`agp_outputs`),
so generated content survives `docker compose down`, image rebuilds, and container
recreation — see [Persisting & retrieving content](#persisting--retrieving-generated-content).

### With local ComfyUI (highest consistency, needs an NVIDIA GPU)

```bash
# set IMAGE_BACKEND=comfyui (and/or VIDEO_BACKEND=comfyui) + COMFYUI_URL in .env
docker compose --profile local up -d comfyui
docker compose run --rm orchestrator run
```

## Quick start (local Python)

```bash
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate     # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
# Requires ffmpeg + ffprobe on PATH (https://ffmpeg.org/download.html)

cp .env.example .env            # then edit
python -m app.main doctor
python -m app.main run
```

## CLI

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `run` | Run the full pipeline from `.env`. |
| `run --dry-run` | Generate only the **creative** artifacts (Visual Bible, lyrics, scene list). Cheap; great for tuning prompts. |
| `run --force` | Ignore saved progress and regenerate from scratch. |
| `run --redo <stages>` | Regenerate only certain stages, keeping the rest cached (see below). |
| `run --stream` / `--no-stream` | Force live streaming on/off for this run (overrides `STREAM_ENABLED`). |
| `run -e path/to/.env` | Use an alternate env file. |
| `stream` | Live-stream an already-generated library on a loop (no generation). `--run <name>` or `--dir <folder>`. |
| `config` | Print the resolved configuration (secrets masked). |
| `doctor` | Verify `ffmpeg`/`ffprobe` are present and the selected backends + stream targets are configured. |
| `version` | Print the version. |

Runs are **resumable**: progress is saved to `state.json` after every expensive step, so
re-running continues where it stopped. Use `--force` to start over.

### Regenerating a single stage (`--redo`)

Sometimes you want to redo *one* step without paying to regenerate everything — the classic
case is **a music service flagging your lyrics as copyrighted** and needing fresh lyrics while
keeping all the (expensive) images and video clips you already made.

```bash
# Rewrite the lyrics + Suno brief and re-burn the lyric overlay, keep all visuals:
docker compose run --rm orchestrator run --redo concept,music,final
```

Valid stages: `bible`, `refs`, `concept` (lyrics), `scenes`, `images`, `videos`,
`music` (audio + Suno brief), `final` (assembly + lyric overlay). Each clears only its own
cached checkpoints; the next `run` regenerates exactly those and reuses the rest.

> **Lyrics & copyright:** the songwriting prompt instructs the LLM to write *original* lyrics
> and never reproduce a copyrighted translation/text verbatim (e.g. NIV/ESV), so output clears
> automated filters like Suno's. If a song still gets flagged, `--redo concept,music,final`
> regenerates it with fresh wording.

---

## Configuration (`.env`)

Everything lives in `.env`. The creative block is all you change between genres:

| Variable | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `GENRE`, `SUB_STYLE`, `THEME`, `MOOD` | The creative brief. |
| `CHARACTER_DESCRIPTION` | **The consistency anchor.** Be physically specific. |
| `STYLE_GUIDE` | Global art direction applied to every shot. |
| `NUM_TRACKS`, `SCENES_PER_TRACK`, `SECONDS_PER_SCENE` | How much to make. |
| `RESOLUTION`, `FPS`, `ASPECT` | Output geometry (`ASPECT` preset overrides `RESOLUTION`). |
| `LLM_PROVIDER` | `claude` \| `openai` \| `grok` |
| `MUSIC_BACKEND` | `suno_thirdparty` \| `local` \| `prompt_only` |
| `IMAGE_BACKEND` | `openai` \| `xai` \| `comfyui` |
| `VIDEO_BACKEND` | `kling` \| `runway` \| `comfyui` |
| `LYRICS_OVERLAY`, `LIPSYNC` | Final-cut extras. |
| `*_API_KEY`, `COMFYUI_URL`, ... | Credentials / endpoints. |
| `SEED`, `OUTPUT_DIR`, `RUN_NAME`, `LOG_LEVEL`, `LOG_PRETTY` | Runtime. |

See [.env.example](.env.example) for the fully-commented reference.

### Backend notes / honest limitations

- **Suno has no official public API.** `MUSIC_BACKEND=prompt_only` (the default) writes
  perfect lyrics + a paste-ready Suno brief to `03_music/` — you render in the Suno web UI,
  drop the audio back in, and re-run to assemble. `suno_thirdparty` targets common relay
  providers (sunoapi.org / EvoLink / 302.ai); endpoint paths are centralised in
  [app/music/suno_thirdparty.py](app/music/suno_thirdparty.py) for easy adaptation.
- **No video backend configured / a scene fails?** The pipeline never dies — it falls back
  to an animated **Ken-Burns** clip of the scene still, so a run always produces a complete,
  correctly-timed video.
- **`MUSIC_BACKEND=local`** ships a correctly-timed *silent* bed so fully-offline runs still
  assemble; swap in your own local model in [app/music/local.py](app/music/local.py).
- **ComfyUI video** requires you to export an API-format workflow and set
  `COMFYUI_VIDEO_WORKFLOW` (video graphs are model-specific). Placeholder tokens
  (`%PROMPT%`, `%REF_IMAGE%`, `%SEED%`, `%FRAMES%`, ...) are substituted at runtime.

## Provider guide — which services to sign up for

> **Create your own first-party accounts** directly with each provider below and load
> credits/subscriptions onto them. **Do not buy pre-made, "aged", or resold accounts** —
> for the streaming platforms in particular, account reselling violates their Terms of
> Service and risks permanent bans and payment-fraud chargebacks; for the AI APIs, shared
> or resold keys get revoked and leak your billing. First-party accounts are cheaper,
> safer, and the only ones these APIs are designed for.

You only need accounts for the backends you actually enable in `.env`. Each stage maps to
one engine. Pricing models below are the *shape* of the cost (pay-as-you-go credits vs flat
subscription) — always check the provider's current pricing page, as rates change.

### 1. Text / LLM — concept, lyrics, Visual Bible, scenes  *(cheapest stage — pennies/run)*

| Provider | Where to sign up | Billing model | Pick it when |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Anthropic Claude** *(default)* | console.anthropic.com | Pre-paid API credits, pay-as-you-go | You want the richest creative writing + reliable structured JSON. |
| **OpenAI** | platform.openai.com | Pre-paid API credits | You also want images from the same account/key (`IMAGE_BACKEND=openai`). |
| **xAI Grok** | console.x.ai | Pre-paid API credits | You're already in the X/Grok ecosystem. |

A whole run's text is a few cents — don't optimize here. Create an account, add a small
credit balance, generate an **API key**, paste into `.env`. **Recommended:** Claude or OpenAI.

### 2. Music — song + lyrics

| Option | Where | Billing | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Suno subscription** *(recommended)* | suno.com | Monthly (Pro/Premier) | Gives commercial-use rights + downloads. Use `MUSIC_BACKEND=prompt_only`: the pipeline writes the brief, you paste it into Suno, drop the audio back in. Most reliable + clean rights. |
| **Third-party Suno relay** | sunoapi.org, 302.AI, EvoLink | Per-credit API key | Enables full automation (`MUSIC_BACKEND=suno_thirdparty`), but it's **unofficial**, ToS-gray, and can break without notice. Check the relay's licensing before commercial use. |
| **Local model** | self-host | Free (your GPU) | `MUSIC_BACKEND=local` is a silent placeholder today; wire in MusicGen/AudioCraft yourself. |

**Recommended:** a Suno subscription + `prompt_only` for rights clarity and reliability;
only use a relay if hands-off automation is worth the fragility.

### 3. Images — character references + scene key-frames

| Option | Where | Billing | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **OpenAI images** | platform.openai.com | Per-image credits | Easiest cloud path; same key as the LLM. Good consistency via the locked character prompt. |
| **xAI / Grok images** | console.x.ai | Per-image credits | `IMAGE_BACKEND=xai` (model `grok-2-image`). Lets a fully Grok pipeline run on **only `XAI_API_KEY`** — no OpenAI account needed. |
| **ComfyUI (local)** *(best consistency)* | github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI | Free software + a GPU | IP-Adapter/ControlNet give true face/wardrobe locking and the lowest per-image cost at volume. Needs an NVIDIA GPU (≥12–16 GB VRAM; RTX 3090/4090 ideal) **or** a rented cloud GPU (below). |

**Recommended:** start on OpenAI (or xAI if you're already all-in on Grok) for simplicity;
move to ComfyUI once you care about tight character consistency or are generating at volume.

### 4. Video — scene clips  *(by far the most expensive stage — budget here)*

| Option | Where | Billing | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Runway** | runwayml.com → dev.runwayml.com | Subscription + API credits | Easiest **official** image-to-video API (Gen-3/Gen-4). Most reliable to automate. |
| **Kling** | klingai.com (API via the Kling/Kuaishou open platform) | Credit packs | Strong, cost-effective image-to-video; API access may require an application. |
| **ComfyUI (local)** | self-host (SVD / AnimateDiff / WAN) | Free software + GPU | Cheapest at scale; needs a capable GPU and a workflow you export yourself. |
| **None / free** | — | $0 | Leave video unset and rely on the **Ken-Burns** still-motion fallback — perfectly fine for calm ambient channels. |

**Recommended:** Runway for the smoothest official API; Kling to cut cost; ComfyUI if you
have the GPU and want volume. Generate short test clips first — video credits burn fast.

### 5. GPU rental (only if you self-host ComfyUI without your own card)

Rent by the hour and point `COMFYUI_URL` at it: **RunPod** (runpod.io), **Vast.ai**
(vast.ai), or **Lambda** (lambdalabs.com). Cheaper than a cloud API once you're producing
a lot, but you manage the box.

### 6. Streaming platforms (free accounts — but each has eligibility rules)

All are **free to create** — you're not buying anything, just enabling live + grabbing a
stream key. Use your own account; see the warning at the top of this section.

| Platform | Get the RTMP key from | Gotchas |
|---|---|---|
| **YouTube Live** | YouTube Studio → Go Live | Verify your account; first-time live enable can take ~24 h. Monetization needs YPP thresholds. |
| **Facebook / Instagram** | Facebook Live Producer (a Page) | Instagram Live uses the same Facebook Live API ingest. |
| **TikTok Live** | TikTok LIVE Studio | Needs LIVE access (often ~1,000 followers) before you get an RTMP key. |
| **Rumble** | Rumble → stream settings | Copy the full RTMP URL (+ key) it shows you. |

### Recommended starter stacks

| Goal | LLM | Music | Image | Video | ~Monthly cost shape |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Cheapest, clean rights** | Claude (PAYG) | Suno sub + `prompt_only` | OpenAI | Ken-Burns fallback ($0) | Suno sub + a few $ of API credits |
| **Balanced cloud** | OpenAI | Suno sub | OpenAI | Runway | Subs + moderate video credits |
| **Max quality / volume** | Claude | Suno sub | ComfyUI (owned/rented GPU) | Kling or ComfyUI | GPU + video credits |

**Budget reality:** text ≈ pennies, music ≈ a flat subscription, images ≈ cheap, **video
dominates** — a single multi-scene track can cost more in video credits than everything
else combined. Prototype with `--dry-run` (creative only, no media spend) and the free
Ken-Burns fallback before turning on a paid video backend.

## Live streaming (24/7, never stops)

Push generated videos to **YouTube Live, TikTok Live, Facebook/Instagram Live, and Rumble**
— all at once — as a single continuous stream that loops the library so the channel
never goes dark.

```bash
# 1. In .env: enable streaming + paste at least one platform key
STREAM_ENABLED=true
STREAM_TARGETS="youtube,facebook,rumble"
YOUTUBE_STREAM_KEY="xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx"
# FACEBOOK_STREAM_KEY=... / TIKTOK_INGEST_URL=... / RUMBLE_INGEST_URL=...

docker compose run --rm orchestrator doctor      # confirm targets resolve
docker compose run --rm orchestrator run         # generate + go live

# Or stream a library you already generated, on a loop:
docker compose run --rm orchestrator stream --run <run-folder-name>
docker compose run --rm orchestrator stream --dir ./outputs/<run>/05_final_videos
```

**Modes** (`STREAM_MODE`):
- `live` — the stream starts immediately (a standby card plays), and each track joins the
  stream the instant it finishes generating. Best for "generate forever" channels.
- `after` — generate the whole library first, then stream it on an endless loop.

**How it stays seamless and never stops:**
- Every finished video is transcoded once into an **MPEG-TS segment** with identical codec
  params (resolution, fps, GOP, 44.1 kHz audio).
- A **single persistent ffmpeg encoder** consumes those segments from a pipe (`-re` paces it
  in realtime), producing one clean continuous timeline, and **fans out to every platform
  simultaneously** via the `tee` muxer (`onfail=ignore` — one platform dropping doesn't take
  down the others).
- A feeder thread keeps the encoder fed; when the queue is empty it **re-loops the existing
  library** (`STREAM_LOOP_WHEN_IDLE=true`), so the wire is never starved. If the encoder
  hiccups it is automatically respawned.

**Platform reality check:**
- **YouTube** & **Facebook/Instagram** have stable RTMP/RTMPS ingest — paste the stream key
  and go. (Instagram uses the same Facebook Live API ingest.)
- **TikTok** requires LIVE access / TikTok Live Studio; when granted it gives you an RTMP
  server URL + key — put them in `TIKTOK_INGEST_URL` / `TIKTOK_STREAM_KEY`.
- **Rumble** gives a full RTMP URL (and key) in your stream settings — paste into
  `RUMBLE_INGEST_URL` / `RUMBLE_STREAM_KEY`.
- `custom` accepts any RTMP/RTMPS endpoint (Twitch, a self-hosted nginx-rtmp relay, etc.).

`ffmpeg` push output is logged to `<run>/logs/stream.log`. Stop a stream with `Ctrl-C`.

## Persisting & retrieving generated content

All output is stored in a **named Docker volume, `agp_outputs`** (mounted at
`/app/outputs` in the container), declared in [docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml).
It is managed by Docker and **persists across `docker compose down`, image rebuilds, and
container recreation** — it is only deleted by an explicit `docker compose down -v` or
`docker volume rm`. (The Dockerfile pre-creates the mount point owned by the non-root
runtime user, so the volume is writable on first run.)

```bash
# Inspect the volume (real name is <project>_agp_outputs)
docker volume ls
docker volume inspect ai-genre-pipeline_agp_outputs

# Copy everything out to ./exported on the host
docker run --rm \
  -v ai-genre-pipeline_agp_outputs:/data \
  -v "$(pwd)/exported:/out" \
  alpine sh -c "cp -a /data/. /out/"

# Back up the whole volume to a tarball
docker run --rm -v ai-genre-pipeline_agp_outputs:/data -v "$(pwd):/backup" \
  alpine tar czf /backup/outputs-backup.tgz -C /data .
```

**Pin it to a specific disk** (e.g. a large drive on a homelab box): uncomment the
`driver_opts` block under `volumes: agp_outputs:` in `docker-compose.yml` and set
`device: /srv/ai-genre-pipeline/outputs`.

**Prefer files directly on the host** (handiest for grabbing finished videos to upload):
swap the volume for a bind mount — comment `- agp_outputs:/app/outputs` and uncomment
`- ./outputs:/app/outputs` in the `orchestrator` service. On Linux, make the host folder
writable by the container user (uid 1000), e.g. `mkdir -p outputs && sudo chown 1000:1000 outputs`.

> Running the pipeline **without Docker** (local Python) already writes straight to
> `./outputs/` on your machine, so nothing extra is needed there.

Each media stage is an **abstract backend + a factory** that reads the `.env` choice.
All backends use a shared `httpx` retry policy (exponential backoff on 5xx/429/network).

---

## Extending the pipeline

### Add a new video provider (e.g. Pika)

1. Create `app/video/pika.py` subclassing `VideoBackendBase` and implement
   `generate(prompt, dest, *, image_path, duration, seed) -> Path`.
2. Add `pika = "pika"` to `VideoBackendKind` in [app/config.py](app/config.py).
3. Wire it into [app/video/factory.py](app/video/factory.py).
4. Add any keys to `Settings` + `.env.example`. Done — select with `VIDEO_BACKEND=pika`.

The same three-step pattern (subclass → enum → factory) adds an LLM, music, or image
provider. Because consistency data flows through the shared models, a new backend
automatically receives the character description, references, and seeds.

### Add a new genre

Copy any `.env.*.example`, edit the creative block (`GENRE` … `CHARACTER_DESCRIPTION` …
`STYLE_GUIDE`), and run. That's the whole workflow.

---

## Roadmap / optional extras

- **Lip-sync** (`LIPSYNC=true`) is wired as a flag; plug a Wav2Lip / LatentSync ComfyUI
  workflow into the video stage to enable it.
- Word-level lyric timing via forced alignment (currently an even split).
- Beat-synced scene cuts driven by audio onset detection.
